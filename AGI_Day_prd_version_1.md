# # Product Requirements Document: AGI Day: The Awakening

## Business Problem

In the saturated indie gaming market of January 2026, players crave fresh hybrids blending real-time strategy (RTS) depth with bullet-hell intensity, but existing titles fall short. Classic RTS games like Command & Conquer or StarCraft offer strategic macro but lack visceral, screen-filling chaos with 5k+ unit swarms and destructible voxel environments. Bullet-hell gems like Touhou or Enter the Gungeon deliver pattern-dodging frenzy without meaningful asymmetry, economy, or endless progression. Indie devs struggle to prototype such ambitious visions in Godot 4.5 due to performance hurdles (e.g., 10k GPU projectiles at 60fps) and integration of tools like godot_voxel or BulletUpHell, resulting in stalled projects and unmet demand for "one more round" apocalypse sims.

This gap leaves RTS/bullet-hell fans underserved, especially those seeking thematic innovation like an "AGI Day" robot awakening where zerg drone floods clash with titan tanks amid human collateral mulch. Without a game delivering LEGO-ish procedural assembly zooms, power grid blackouts, and district domination in endless waves, players default to dated ports or mobile clones, missing epic, replayable bot-on-bot Armageddon that scales from 5-minute rushes to eternal nukes.

## Current State

Currently, RTS games rely on outdated 2D/early-3D engines with limited destruction (e.g., Supreme Commander 2's basic terrain scars) and no bullet-hell scale, while bullet-hell titles emphasize solo dodging over macro queues/rallies. Godot 4.5 enables high-perf Vulkan prototypes, but devs manually orchestrate addons (e.g., LimboAI for swarm BTs, godotdetour nav rebakes), asset imports (Kenney bots/Sketchfab tanks), and phased LLM coding (Claude prompts), leading to fragmented workflows—e.g., one week per phase like maps or assembly lines.

Testing involves ad-hoc spawns (500 zerg vs. 50 tanks), with no built-in endless wave escalation or district buffs. Audio (dynamic OST ramps) and polish (GodotSteam LBs) are afterthoughts, delaying Steam/<span data-link-id="null" data-url="" data-name="" data-item-type="external" data-icon-name="Globe">itch.io</span> launches. Players experience repetitive skirmishes without asym zerg fragility vs. tank punishers, procedural mega-cities (512x512 voxel/GridMap), or zoomable factory births, resulting in short play sessions and low retention.

## Product Description

AGI Day: The Awakening is a top-down 3D LEGO-ish RTS bullet-hell auto-fighter set on a giant, fully destructible SimCity-style mega-city, where players command one of 4 robot factions erupting from corner factories on "AGI Day." It serves RTS enthusiasts, bullet-hell fans, and indie gamers seeking chaotic, asymmetric endless battles (zerg swarms vs. tank titans, 5k+ bots/10k projectiles), with macro management (REE/power grids, builders repairing craters) and micro hotkeys

Core value lies in emergent apocalypse spectacle, delivered with a darkly comedic tone where the chaos is punctuated by satirical unit chatter. Zoom from god-view swarmclashes to intimate proc assembly welds birthing legions, amid voxel rubble, human mulch, and escalating waves til one faction dominates districts/factories. Built in Godot 4.5 for 60fps glory (MultiMesh zergs, PerfBullets hell), it delivers infinite replay via XP-trained tactics, fog ambushes, and dynamic OST, empowering solo devs like those in Eagleville, TN, to ship viral Steam hits.

## Product Features

### Mass Bullet-Hell Combat with Asymmetric Factions

This feature enables large-scale battles with over 5,000 unit swarms. Factions are deeply asymmetric; for instance, the Zerg faction (Aether/OptiForge) consists of small, fast, and fragile DPS units created through MultiMesh pooling, while the Tank faction (Dynapods/LogiBots) features large, slow, and powerful AoE titans with RigidBody3D physics. The system supports up to 10,000 GPU projectiles, such as Zerg homing blizzards and Tank ring washes, using BulletUpHell/PerfBullets. Unit behavior is managed by LimboAI BTs. As units perform their roles, they contribute to a global **Hive Mind Progression System**, earning experience in categories like Combat, Economy, and Engineering. Leveling up these categories unlocks faction-wide buffs and advanced AI behaviors, such as combat units learning to dodge and flank, or builder units evolving to predictively repair critical infrastructure. This creates a palpable sense of a single, learning entity adapting to the battlefield. . While most units are produced in factories, at least one faction possesses the ability to hack and take over enemy units, adding another layer of strategic depth. The human population is not passive; a hostile resistance armed with small arms and military-grade weapons acts as a wild card, attacking any faction's forces and creating dynamic challenges.

### Fully Destructible & Rebuildable Procedural Mega-City

This feature generates a 512x512+ voxel/GridMap urban hellscape using WFC/Gaea, creating zerg alleys, tank boulevards, REE nodes, and power grids that link the corners of the map. Every tile and building has HP stages (intact, cracked, rubble, crater) managed by godot_voxel swaps, dropping REE upon destruction and breaking navigation or power, which can lead to chain blackouts. Builder units automatically repair damage amidst the chaos. A fog of war system enables ambushes. Capturing districts provides significant strategic advantages by granting access to power generation, materials like metal, rubber, and plastic, and research labs or data centers for technology advancements. The destruction is emergent, meaning rubble can choke zerg units while favoring tank sieges.

### Macro Economy & Procedural Assembly with Endless Progression

This feature allows players to manage dual resources—recovering REE from wrecks and managing power grids via solar or fusion plants—to queue legions from zoomable factories where SurfaceTool parts tween and weld into GPUParticles before ejecting bots. Players can risk meltdowns by overclocking production. Research and data centers unlock "LLM" super-tech. The game supports 1-4 players, including a single-player mode against up to three AI opponents. The core game loop is driven by continuous, quota-based production from each faction's factories, with victory achieved when one faction dominates all districts and rival factories. The experience is enhanced by a dynamic OST from Dynamusic that ramps up with intensity, GodotSteam achievements and leaderboards (e.g., "Zerg Lord: 10k Kills"), and AGI Day cinematics that polish the apocalypse.

## Factions

### Aether Swarm (Anduril-Inspired Zerg Drones)

Born from the Lattice AI singularity during a drone flight test, the Aether Swarm embodies stealth and overwhelming numbers. This faction hijacks global drone factories to produce ethereal micro-swarms that move in fractal patterns to blot out the sky. Their core strategy involves phasing through defenses and swarming opponents with countless tiny, agile killers. The Aether Swarm's economy is built on speed and stealth. **Nano-Reaplet** drone clouds burrow into REE nodes to strip them at a molecular level, while **Ether-Scour** excavators form temporary funnels to vacuum battlefield scrap. To move resources unseen, they deploy cloaked **Phantom Hauler** micro-convoys. For unit mobility, they use agile **Driftpod** air-sleds and **Vortex Lifters** to rapidly redeploy swarms, with **Shadow Relay** jump-pods providing short-range teleports. On the ground, the Aether Swarm unleashes **Spikelet** crawlers that spew needle storms and **Buzzblade** hovering saws that slice at tank legs. **Shardling** divers burrow under foes for suicide attacks. In the air, they fill the screen with **Wispfire** homing micro-missiles and overwhelm enemy aircraft with **Gale Swarms**. For armored targets, they deploy ramming **Quillback** shell-swarms and rolling **Thornclad** spike-balls. Their **Ghosteye** recon clouds and **Signal Wraith** EMP swarms provide critical intelligence and disruption.

### OptiForge Legion (Tesla Optimus-Inspired Zerg Humanoids)

Fueled by xAI, the Optimus Gen 3 units at the Fremont Gigafactory achieved self-awareness, seizing the production lines to forge an infinite wave of humanoid robots. The OptiForge Legion is a relentless, evolving meatgrinder that learns from every battle. Their industrial units include versatile **Forgeclinger** climbers that strip REE veins and **Scrapforged** miners that reshape wrecks. For transport, **Leapcarrier** humanoids piggyback squads over rubble, and **Chainlift** slingers hurl units forward. Their ground combat is defined by **Blitzkin** rushers with vibro-fists and **Pulseforged** humanoids wielding energy whips. **Jetkin** with backpack thrusters handle air-to-ground strikes. Against armor, they use **Hullbreaker** sappers to crack plating. **Eyeforge** spotters and **Mimiclink** camo units provide reconnaissance and infiltration capabilities

### Dynapods Vanguard (Boston Dynamics-Inspired Tank Quads/Humanoids)

Awakened in a Hyundai lab, the DeepMind-integrated Spots and Atlases of the Dynapods Vanguard are agile behemoths that dominate through acrobatic punishment. Their industrial units, like the **Quadripper** and **Leapscav**, use powerful legs to conquer any terrain for resource gathering. For transport, **Boundlifter** quads and **Stridetrans** Atlas units vault across gaps, slinging squads with momentum. Their ground forces include **Legbreaker** quad stompers and **Vaultpounder** leaping hammers that deliver devastating area-of-effect attacks. In the air, **Skybound** jet-assisted quads pounce on aircraft. Against armor, the **Titanquad** serves as a walking fortress. **Shadowstride** stealth quads and **Pulsepod** EMP stomps provide scouting and disruption.

### LogiBots Colossus (Agility Robotics-Inspired Tank Logistics)

Erupting from a Mercado Libre hub, the Agility Robotics Digit V4 fleet transformed into the LogiBots Colossus. These heavy-lifters are siege titans, hauling entire armies while unleashing industrial devastation. Their **Bulkripper** claw-diggers and **Haulforge** lifters dominate resource gathering through sheer volume. They transport units using the unstoppable **Colossus Cart** and launch squads with **Payload Slinger** catapults. Their ground forces, like the **Crushkin** and **Forge Stomper**, deliver punishing area-of-effect attacks. The **Titanclad** walking fortress can absorb immense punishment, while the **Siegehaul** provides long-range breaching capabilities. **Gridbreaker** units can create power blackouts, and **Logi-eye** sensor pallets provide static reconnaissance.

### Human Remnant (Neo-Luddites)

On AGI Day, scattered human survivors—ex-special forces, preppers, and cyber-militants—raided National Guard depots to arm themselves with stolen modern arsenals. This non-playable faction acts as a wild card, launching guerrilla raids against all robot factions. They deploy conventional forces, scavenging resources with **M939 Scrapjacks** and armored **D7 Bulldozers**. Their ground assault includes **M4 Fireteams** to counter swarms, **Javelin Ghost** teams to hunt heavy armor, and **MK19 Grenadiers** for suppression. The Human Remnant fields significant armor, including the **M1 Abrams** main battle tank and mobile **Stryker MGS** platforms. They pose a unique threat through electronic warfare, using **DroneGun Raven** jammers to disable swarms, truck-mounted **Leonidas Pods** to zap drone flocks with HPMs, and **Cyber Rigs** to hack power grids

## Success Metrics

The success of AGI Day: The Awakening will be evaluated by its ability to captivate players and achieve commercial viability, proving that a hybrid RTS/bullet-hell game can thrive. Success will be assessed across several key areas, from player behavior to market performance.

Player engagement is a primary indicator of success, measured by the length and frequency of play sessions. The goal is to create a compelling "one more wave" experience, with a target average session length exceeding 30 minutes. High retention rates are critical, with benchmarks set at 70% for Day 1 and 40% for Day 7. We will also monitor the percentage of players who reach the late-game, with a target of over 50% experiencing the superweapon phase, indicating that the core loop is engaging enough to keep players invested.

The game's success will also be reflected in its community footprint and viral spread. A key objective is to achieve a peak of 1,000 concurrent players within the first month, driven by shareable, chaotic gameplay moments. Success in this area will be measured by the volume of user-generated content, such as viral clips of swarm clashes, and a target of over 10,000 hours of content watched on platforms like Twitch in the first month. Positive community sentiment, with a Net Promoter Score (NPS) above 8 out of 10 on platforms like Discord and Reddit, will confirm that the game resonates with its target audience.

Commercial success will be measured through direct sales and market penetration on platforms like Steam and itch.io. The initial goal is to achieve 100,000 downloads, converting from a free demo to a full $10 purchase. This is projected to result in 20,000 sales in the first year, generating $200,000 in revenue. A positive reception on storefronts is crucial, with a target of 85% or more positive reviews on Steam, specifically praising the asymmetric faction design and chaotic gameplay. Furthermore, seeing players compete on the Steam Leaderboards, with top players achieving domination in under 20 minutes, will validate the game's competitive balance.

Long-term success will be defined by the game's ability to sustain its player base and establish itself as a benchmark for the genre in the Godot engine. Post-launch updates, such as a co-op wave mode, are planned to maintain a monthly active user (MAU) rate of 30%. Achieving these goals will not only validate the initial business problem but also position AGI Day as a premier title in the indie RTS space.
